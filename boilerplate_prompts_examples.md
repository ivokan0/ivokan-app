# üöÄ Prompt Template & Examples for Extending React Native Expo Supabase Boilerplate

This document contains:
- A **generic prompt template** for adding new features to your existing boilerplate.
- **Ready-to-use prompt examples** for common app functionalities.

---

## üìå Generic Prompt Template

```
You are an expert in React Native + Expo + TypeScript + Supabase.  
We already have a boilerplate project with:
- Expo SDK (latest stable) + TypeScript
- Supabase client in `src/services/supabase.ts`
- AuthContext for login/signup/session
- Navigation with AuthStack, AppTabs
- i18n (EN/FR) with `react-i18next`
- SplashScreen, WelcomeScreen
- Media utilities (CameraPicker, GalleryPicker, DocumentPicker, SupabaseUploader, FilePreview)

Your task:
Add a new feature: [DESCRIBE FEATURE CLEARLY HERE].

Requirements:
1. Describe the exact files to create or update.
2. Use TypeScript and follow the existing folder structure (`src/screens`, `src/components`, `src/services`, etc.).
3. Use Supabase for database/storage if needed.
4. Integrate i18n for all text labels (English/French).
5. If the feature needs navigation, update the navigator accordingly.
6. Ensure UI is styled consistently with the rest of the app (use [react-native-paper OR nativewind], depending on boilerplate choice).
7. Add necessary validations and error handling.
8. Add example usage in an existing screen or navigation entry.
9. Include any new `.env` variables in `.env.example`.
10. Write comments in English.

Output:
- Updated/created files with full code.
- Short explanation of how to test this new feature in the app.

You are an expert in React Native + Expo + TypeScript + Supabase.  
We already have a boilerplate project with:  
- Expo SDK (latest stable) + TypeScript  
- Supabase client in `src/services/supabase.ts`  
- AuthContext, navigation, i18n, splash, welcome, media utilities  

Your task:  
Add a new feature: [FEATURE DESCRIPTION].  

First:  
1. Define and create any necessary Supabase tables, buckets, and Row Level Security policies.  
2. Provide SQL or Supabase CLI commands for these.  
3. Explain how to apply them in Supabase dashboard.  

Then:  
1. Update the React Native project to implement this feature using the new Supabase structure.  
2. Use TypeScript and existing folder structure.  
3. Integrate i18n for text.  
4. Handle validations and errors.  
5. Output updated/created files with comments in English.  



You are an expert in React Native + Expo + TypeScript + Supabase.  
We already have a boilerplate project with:  
[boilerplate features]  

The required Supabase structure already exists:  
- Table(s): [TABLE NAME + DESCRIPTION]  
- Bucket(s): [BUCKET NAME + DESCRIPTION]  

Do NOT recreate or modify these tables/buckets.  
Just implement the new feature using the existing structure.

Requirements:  
1. Use the provided table/bucket as-is.  
2. Fetch, insert, and update data according to the existing schema.  
3. Update the React Native project in `src/` accordingly.  
4. Use TypeScript, i18n, error handling.  
5. Follow existing UI style (nativewind or react-native-paper).  
6. Output updated/created files with comments in English.
